* Welcome
This repo follows loosely along the so-called [[https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala]["redbook"]]. There is probably nothing new, just personal notes on the exercises. The unspoken goal is to bend some [[file:exercises/src/main/scala/fpinscala/][exercises]] into the more abstract [[https://zio.dev/][ZIO]] field which is on my learning list for far too long. We'll see, if I succeed I'll write a blog post about it:)

This repo will contain most work from the original repo: [[https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala]]. This repo is written *Scala 2*!
